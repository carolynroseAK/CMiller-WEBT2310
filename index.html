                            1. Be skeptical of unexpected messages
                            Don’t click on links or open attachments from unfamiliar senders.
                            Even if a message looks like it’s from a friend or company, double-check—scammers often impersonate trusted sources.</p>
                        <p>2. Pause before acting on urgency
                            Scammers use panic to pressure you.
                            If someone says “act now” or “don’t tell anyone,” stop and talk to someone you trust.</p>
